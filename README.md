### A digital space for exploring the intersection between art and tech

<samp>
As a software engineer with a soft spot for art and design, I am passionate about bringing both the technical and creative aspects of digital products to life; by developing and designing experiences that translate digital creations into physical inventions. 
I realized that I needed a space where I can document my creative endeavors, craft, interests, cool findings, experiences, DIYs etc., a place where I can show a bit of me and hoping that it can be of use to you. ‚úø œü
