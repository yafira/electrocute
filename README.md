### A digital space for exploring the intersection between art and tech

<samp>
As a software engineer with a soft spot for art and design, I am passionate about bringing both the technical and creative aspects of digital products to life; by developing and designing experiences that translate digital creations into physical inventions.

‘Electrocute’ is something I’ve been meaning to work on for the longest but finally decided to just do it! I realized that I needed a space where I can document my creative endeavors, craft, interests, cool findings, experiments, DIYs etc., a place where I can show a bit of me and hoping that it can be of use to you. I amm hoping it can spark inspiration, growth, and all around magic!. ϟ
